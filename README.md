# ai_chat_api for mayor_sim

## Overview

The `ai_chat_api` is a crucial component of the "mayor_sim" game. It facilitates communication between non-player characters (NPCs) and the game world, utilizing a Language Model (LLM) for natural language conversations.

## Features

- **NPC Chat**: The API enables NPCs in the "mayor_sim" game to engage in dynamic and context-aware conversations with players.

- **Language Model Integration**: It seamlessly integrates with a Language Model (LLM) to generate realistic and diverse NPC responses.

## Usage

To utilize the API in your "mayor_sim" game, you can make HTTP requests to the API endpoints for NPC interactions. For example:

import requests
# Define the URL to send a POST request to
url = 'https://game.overlord-loki.com/generate'
# Define the headers for the request
headers = {'Content-Type': 'application/json'}
# Define the prompt that will be sent as JSON data
prompt = 'In order to make homemade bread, follow these steps:\n1)'
# Create a dictionary with the prompt
data = {'prompt': prompt}
# Send a POST request to the specified URL with JSON data and headers
response = requests.post(url, json=data, headers=headers)
# Check if the response status code is 200 (OK)
if response.status_code == 200:
    # If the response is successful, parse the JSON content
    result = response.json()
    # Print the result
    print(result)
else:
    # If the response is not successful, print an error message with the status code
    print(f'Request failed with status code {response.status_code}')
```

## Configuration

Make sure to configure the API by editing the `config.json` file with your specific LLM credentials and any other relevant settings.
